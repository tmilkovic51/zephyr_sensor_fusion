properties:
  accel-dev:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Phandle of the accelerometer device to be used for sensor fusion.

  gyro-dev:
    type: phandle
    required: true
    description: |
      Phandle of the gyroscope device to be used for sensor fusion.

  magn-dev:
    type: phandle
    description: |
      Phandle of the magnetometer device to be used for sensor fusion.
      If not present, sensor fusion will be done with accelerometer
      and gyroscope only.

  earth-axes-convention:
    type: int
    description: |
      Earth axes convention. Possible values:
        0 = North-West-Up
        1 = East-North-Up
        2 = North-East-Down
    default: 0
    enum:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2

  gyro-gain:
    type: int
    description: |
       Determines the influence of the gyroscope relative to other
       sensors, in percent. A value of zero percent will disable
       initialisation and the acceleration and magnetic rejection
       features. A value of 50 is appropriate for most applications.
    default: 50

  gyro-range:
    type: int
    description: |
        Gyroscope range, in degrees per second. Angular rate recovery
        will activate if the gyroscope measurement exceeds 98% of this
        value. A value of zero will disable this feature.
        The value should be set to the range specified in the
        gyroscope datasheet. Default is 250 degrees per second (dps).
    default: 250

  accel-rejection:
    type: int
    description: |
        Threshold (in degrees) used by the acceleration rejection
        feature. A value of zero will disable this feature.
        A value of 10 degrees is appropriate for most applications.
    default: 10

  magn-rejection:
    type: int
    description: |
        Threshold (in degrees) used by the magnetic rejection
        feature. A value of zero will disable the feature.
        A value of 10 degrees is appropriate for most applications.
    default: 10

  recovery-trigger-period:
    type: int
    description: |
        Acceleration and magnetic recovery trigger period, in samples.
        A value of zero will disable the acceleration and magnetic
        rejection features. A period of 5 seconds is appropriate
        for most applications. If collecting 100 samples per second,
        the appropriate value would be 500 samples.
    default: 500

  target-sample-rate-hz:
    type: int
    description: |
        Target sample rate of running the sensor fusion algorithm, in Hz.
        Set this to number of sensor_sample_fetch function calls you plan
        to implement in your application code.
        Default value is 100 Hz (100 times per second).
    default: 100
